# Laravel / Codeception demo

A demo repository featuring the capabilities of Codeception testing framework when used with Laravel.

## Overview

You might be wondering why there is a need for Codeception when Laravel's testing tools already work out of the box. And 
that's true -- there's really no reason why you should be using a tool like Codeception for a small app.

But as your app evolves, you'll find yourself needing to do more than just simple unit tests and feature tests -- you'll 
need batteries. This is where Codeception comes in: it provides you with the additional tools to make testing easier 
and more streamlined and structured. 

## Prerequisites

1. A basic idea of what tests are
1. PHP 7.x
1. Yarn 1.6.x
1. A web server

## Installation steps

1. `cd` into the project.
1. Run `composer install`.
1. Run `yarn`.
1. Run `./vendor/bin/codecept run`.

## Notes

The _README_ for this repo is still a work-in-progress.
